//Q1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
//A1
    when I want to save my work elsewhere (other than local)
    when I want to collaborate
//Q2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
//A2
    to make sure I keep track of the process
//Q3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
//A3
    forks are like copies of repositories on github (used online)
    clones are copies of repositories from github to my local machine
    branches are a way of working on a codebase for version/features/fixes etc while 
    keeping a master-version running/untouched while the work is in progress
//Q4
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
//A4
    to answer with the alternative scenario: when not doing it I may run so out of sync that pushing my
    changes once finished will become extra hard, more contributions I miss mean more potential merge
    conflicts to resolve, just as we try to keep commits as reasonably small as possible we should merge
    and sync (push/pull) as often as possible (all within reason) to keep contribution as smooth as possible
    for everyone
